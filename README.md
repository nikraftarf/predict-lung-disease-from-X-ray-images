# predict-lung-disease-from-X-ray-images

I used https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jctsfj2sfn/1 (COVID19, Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray PA Dataset) for my project. 
I split the data into two subfolders (test and train), and I uploaded them to my cloud for using it in my google colab.
The whole project was done in Python language within the Tensorflow library. The model used is InceptionResNetV2.
Some invalid jpg images were in the test folder, so I removed them.
