# predict-lung-disease-from-X-ray-images

I used https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jctsfj2sfn/1 (COVID19, Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray PA Dataset) for my project. 
I splitted the data to 2 subfolders (test and train) and I uploaded them to my cloud for using it in my colab.
The whole project done in Python language within Tensorflow library. The model used is InceptionResNetV2.
There were some invalid jpg images in test folder so I removed them.
